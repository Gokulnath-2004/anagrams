Convert both integers A and B into strings a and b
2. If the lengths of a and b are different, return False
3. Create two arrays count_a and count_b of size 10 
4. Initialize all elements of count_a and count_b to 0
5. Traverse a and increment the count of the digit at each index in count_a
6. Traverse b and increment the count of the digit at each index in count_b
7. If count_a is equal to count_b, return True, else return False
